EEG Signals from Mind to detect mood and Weather based mood sensing to play the songs using Spotify API

Using EEG data signals from Muse, we detect the mood of the person with 90% accuracy on training data set and 85% accuracy on test data set. We have applied Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classify these mood signals. With this mood, using Spotify API we are able to suggest songs playlist to the user.
